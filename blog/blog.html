                    <td>
                      The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The forEach() method is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The find() method returns the value of the first element in the array that
                      satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns
                      undefined. If only a single value is needed use find().

          <table class="table align-middle">
            <thead>
              <tr class="fs-5">
                <th>Local Storage</th>
                <th>Session Storage</th>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  Local storage is the easiest to understand since it never expires. Once you store data in local storage it will stay there until you manually remove it or the user manually removes it.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Session storage data will expire as soon as you close the tab you are on. This is because session storage is tied to a particular session which is equivalent to a tab so once you close your tab you are closing your session thus all session storage is cleared.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Cookies are unique in that you can set the expiration date for them manually. This gives you complete control over how long cookies last for.

        <h4>Question-3: What is <span class="fw-bold">Event Loop?</span> How does it work?</h4>
        <h4><span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Answer:</span></h4>
        <p>
          The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the code after an async function has executed.
          <br>
          The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
