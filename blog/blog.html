                      The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The forEach() method is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      The find() method returns the value of the first element in the array that
                      satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns
                      undefined. If only a single value is needed use find().

            <thead>
              <tr class="fs-5">

              <tr>
                <td>
                  Local storage is the easiest to understand since it never expires. Once you store data in local storage it will stay there until you manually remove it or the user manually removes it.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Session storage data will expire as soon as you close the tab you are on. This is because session storage is tied to a particular session which is equivalent to a tab so once you close your tab you are closing your session thus all session storage is cleared.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Cookies are designed for smaller amounts of data and can be accessed by any website that has access to them. Cookies can be persistent or temporary, depending on how they are set up by the developer.

        <h4>Question-3: What is <span class="fw-bold">Event Loop?</span> How does it work?</h4>
        <h4><span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Answer:</span></h4>
        <p>
          The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the code after an async function has executed.
          <br>
          The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

      <h4>(a). quizTimer function description:</h4>
      <p>
        The quizTimer function takes one argument dismiss. The function is using
        an interval timer to update the timer count. <br />
        Here's a brief overview of what the function is doing:
        <br>
        If dismiss is true, the function clears the timer using
        clearInterval() and returns. Otherwise, the function uses setInterval() to execute a callback function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). The callback function gets the HTML element with the ID "count" and
        updates its innerHTML to display the current count in minutes and
        seconds format. It also updates the count variable by incrementing it
        by 1 on each interval.
      </p>

      <h4>(b). chooseQuiz function description:</h4>
      <p>
        The function takes two arguments index and givenAns. The function
        updates an array called answers based on the quiz question at the given
        index and the answer given by the user.<br />
        Here's a brief overview of what the function is doing:
        <br>
        The function first checks whether an object with the same id property
        as the quiz question at the given index already exists in the answers
        array using the find() method.  If an object with the same id property exists in the answers array, the function finds the index of that object using a for loop and the splice() method to update the givenAns property of the object with the new answer provided by the user. Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers() function to update the user interface with the updated answers array.
